                <h3>First tests batch</h3>

                <p>
                    This batch of tests checks all kinds of static get requests.
                    The only middle ware used here is static with '/static'
                    resource.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        GET requests for '/static' and '/static/' to verify that
                        the RegExp works as expected.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        GET request for '/stat' to verify that user can't get
                        resource that wasn't declared.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        GET request for '/static' using the second port that is
                        listening and verifying that the first port is still
                        listening for same app's requests.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Second tests batch</h3>

                <p>
                    This batch of tests checks the use of parameters, json and
                    urlencoded. It also checks the use of next().
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        First handler pushed is put which adds a parameter to
                        the request object and calls next. Next handler verifies
                        that this parameter was set indeed. This handler checks
                        also the call to use (or get, post, put, delete) without
                        resource argument.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        PUT request that sends two parameters and a JSON body.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        PUT request that has two values in it's body. Body is in
                        the form of urlencoded.
                    </li>

                <h3>Third tests batch</h3>
                <p>
                    This batch of tests checks the use of cookieParser.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        GET request that the client initiates. The server should
                        respond with 'Set-Cookie' header.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        GET request that the client initiates. The request
                        should include the first cookie sent from the server
                        earlier. The server responds with a new extra cookie.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        GET request that the client initiates. This request
                        should include the two cookies that were sent by the
                        server earlier. Server verifies that both of the cookies
                        are set.

                This simple test ask for three files, 3000 times for each of the
                files. The tester compares the content of each response to the
                original file read from disk. At the end, the tester waits for
                10 seconds before checking the results to ensure that all
                requests are made.
